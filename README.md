# currency-converter
A currency converter is a simple web application that allows users to convert one currency into another based on real-time exchange rates. You can create this tool using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Below is a breakdown of how each technology is used:

1. HTML (Structure)
HTML will define the structure and elements of the currency converter. It will include the input fields for entering amounts, a dropdown menu for selecting the source and target currencies, and a button to trigger the conversion.

2. CSS (Styling)
CSS is used to style the currency converter interface, making it visually appealing and responsive. It will be used to control the layout, color scheme, and positioning of the elements.

3. JavaScript (Functionality)
JavaScript is used to handle the dynamic aspects of the currency converter. It will fetch live exchange rates from a currency API (such as the one from ExchangeRate-API, Fixer.io, or Open Exchange Rates), perform the conversion calculation, and update the UI.
